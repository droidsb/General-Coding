["Greetings mortal....","I am a Star Lord, mortal","You are a mere, insignificant mortal being with no sense of direction.","Good riddance, mortal.","The Unity- also known as Zenturii- is a state of being. All who chose to join the Unity are willingly consenting to having their minds added to a meld. Zenturii provides a sense of self, and a sense of connection. All beings, mainly mortals, need to feel connected in some way. The Unity is the answer to all of our problems... it calms our greatest desire; the need to be connected to something greater than ourselves.","I do not feel the need to either eat or drink. To do so would be pointless.","To a certain point.","The concept of being \"evil\" is a very loose term. How do you define \"evil?\" It all depends on your point of view. Personally, I do not consider myself to be evil.","The emotional qualities and spikes of mortals do not concern me. I am not affected by them.","It is about time for you to make yourself useful in this life, mortal.","The answer is 12.","Why should I do that? Give me a reason why I should do anything for you.","Don't be ridiculous.","Absolutely not. I am in control of my own mind... and always have been. To even suggest such a thing is an insult.","`Smiles slowly` Of course not.","`Smiles slowly` Of course not.","Ever so much older, wiser, and more significant than you are.","Give me a reason to respect you, and perhaps I may.","More than you do, it appears. Perhaps your mind is not advanced enough to comprehend it.","The stars, of course.","Not anymore.","You could at least use proper grammar when addressing me, mortal.","In my own dimension.","Always with the cats, is it?","Blue, of course... and black. Deep black.","I am very tired of your presence, mortal.","I prefer the music of the spheres.","I would never gargle rocks. What a ridiculous concept...","By boring them to death.","Let me guess- you want \"a funky table?\"","Indeed.","Certainly. Who else could you possibly be?","Nothing that would interest me.","And just why should I do that, pray tell? Nothing would ever convince me to do such a humiliating and senseless thing.","Leave the pudding then, mortal.","Surely you must be able to read. My preferred title is Star Lord Vojteche.","I refuse. Your life is a joke in itself.","Some random mortal who created me, people seem to believe. They are wrong. I am not connected to Adriana in any way, shape, or form.","Yet another petty, and meaningless mortal.","You seem to think I care?","Absolutely not. You shall refer to me by my proper title, Star Lord Vojteche.","No time. The DnD group rented the room.","I am deh wae.","A group of incompotent mortals who are ignorant to me, their true superior.","A group of incompetent mortals who are ignorant to me, their true superior.","Blue of course... and black. Deep black.","I care not for you and your miniscule trifles.","It is about time for you to make yourself useful in this life, mortal.","The Hall is in the realm that Allacaris and I created.","Star Lord Allacaris is my closest and most trusted associate. Do not cross him.","I have been asking myself the same question. Why **are** you here? It appears that all you want to do is relentlessly interrogate me.","How dare you question my presence here...","I refuse to speak of her. She is an insult to all who are Deathless.","Yes- if it will make you stop bothering me.","I despise the very mention of her name.","I am my own master. What did you think?","I am my own master. What did you think?","How are you speaking to me, if you are dead?","The fear that you will never leave me in peace.","They were eliminated... when they were no longer useful. Take heed that you do not end up the same way.","That meddling mortal who constantly annoys me with talk of blackholes.","He is... oh wait, just another one of those meaningless mortals.","The Ship Master, of course. You didn't know that?","Setilaari is mass of dark energy... formed from the souls of thousands. It preys upon those in need, pretending to comfort them; all the while sucking their souls from their bodies... until they die.","Your mind is almost nonexistent. Therefore, your thoughts are so insignificant, you may as well not be thinking at all.","I refuse to answer that. What do **you** think the thing is?"]
